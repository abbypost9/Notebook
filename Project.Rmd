The Nebraska Women’s basketball team had a season unlike any of the recent years. Many deemed it "special" with the success they had. Starting the year off with a 12-0 record, Nebraska had built up its confidence heading into Big Ten play. Led by Amy Williams the Huskers completed their season 24-9 with a trip to the NCAA tournament as an 8th seed. One thing the Husker team couldn’t mark off its list of accomplishments was making it into the top 25 at any point in the season. Husker fans questioned the reasoning behind this all season long. Was this on purpose or was Nebraska overlooked?

Without looking at NCAA tournament wins and losses, Nebraska had a 24-8 record. When comparing its record to other teams that did earn spots in the top rankings, Nebraska was sixteenth in winning percentage. The Huskers came about two percent behind Iowa, who it faced and lost to three times during the season. Nebraska had a higher winning percentage compared to Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Arizona, who were ranked 18, 19, and 22 ,respectively, in the AP Poll at the end of the season.

Some of Nebraska's other successes that some may say have proved worthy of a spot in the AP poll during the season came from wins over ranked opponents. The first big win was taking down the at the time number eight ranked Michigan. Next, Nebraska defeated number five ranked Indiana in front of the home crowd. Nebraska then also beat Michigan a second time while knocking them out of the Big Ten Tournament. During this game Michigan had snagged the 10th spot in the AP Rankings. These three huge wins may give reason for Nebraska to have been looked at in earning spots in the rankings. Even if they were looked at, these wins weren't deemed enough to place them there.
